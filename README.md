# Fitness Tracker ML

This repository contains the code for a full machine learning project that tracks fitness activities. The project demonstrates the process of building a fitness tracker using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will create a fitness tracker application that uses machine learning to analyze and predict fitness activities. The application includes the following features:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Building and training a machine learning model
- Evaluating the model
- Deploying the model in a fitness tracker application

## YouTube Tutorial

The project is based on the YouTube tutorial "Full Machine Learning Project â€” Coding a Fitness Tracker with Python" by Code It Like Them. You can watch the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCONIdrM2VI&list=PL-Y17yukoyy0sT2hoSQxn1TdV0J7-MX4K&index=1).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.
