# Fitness Tracker ML

This repository contains the code for a full machine learning project that tracks fitness activities. The project demonstrates the process of building a fitness tracker using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will create a fitness tracker application that uses machine learning to analyze and predict fitness activities. The application includes the following features:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Building and training a machine learning model
- Evaluating the model
- Deploying the model in a fitness tracker application

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.
