# Fitness Tracker ML

This repository contains the code for a full machine learning project that tracks fitness activities. The project demonstrates the process of building a fitness tracker using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will create a fitness tracker application that uses machine learning to analyze and predict fitness activities. The application includes the following features:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Building and training a machine learning model
- Evaluating the model
- Deploying the model in a fitness tracker application

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.

## Project Progress
- Part 1 — Introduction, goal, quantified self, MetaMotion sensor, dataset
- Part 2 — Converting raw data, reading CSV files, splitting data, cleaning
- Part 3 — Visualizing data, plotting time series data
- Part 4 — Outlier detection, Chauvenet’s criterion, local outlier factor
- Part 5 — Feature engineering, frequency, low pass filter, PCA, clustering
- Part 6 — Predictive modelling, Naive Bayes, SVMs, random forest, neural network
- Part 7 — Counting repetitions, creating a custom algorithm

**PART 1 - Introduction, goal, quantified self, MetaMotion sensor, dataset**
